# BrainMotionAnalyses

The objective of this project is to perform a systematic comparison of available data on ex vivo and in vivo traumatic brain injury (TBI) studies by Hardy et al. (Hardy) and Whyte et al (Whyte), respectively. The secondary goal of the experiment is to compare the results of allometric and Pi theorem scaling. Literature about brain motion in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments on TBI have been compiled for analysis and illumination in the field of biomechanics. The data has been digitized, processed, then visualized using Python and Excel. As a consequence, Pi theorem scaling was identified as the most holistic scaling approach, and in vivo experimentation has been concluded to yield more reliable results than ex vivo. 

This repo provides the code for the research.
